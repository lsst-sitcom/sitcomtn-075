    Primary Objectives & \tabitem Characterize ghosts and scattered light \\
      & \tabitem Bright star profile / wings of the PSF \\
      & \tabitem Robustness of single-frame processing to presence of bright star \\
      & \tabitem Appropriate mask design for bright stars \\
      & \tabitem Test ISR including, crosstalk, bleed trails \\

    Additional Goals &  \\
    \midrule
    Prerequisites & \tabitem LED flats have been acquired \\
      & \tabitem Monochromatic flats have been acquired \\
    \midrule
    Total Visits & 4 fields \times 30 visits \times 6 bands = 720 visits \\
    \midrule
    Overlapping Visits & Single pointing, minimal dither \\
    \midrule
    Band Coverage & $(u)griz(y)$, prioritize $griz$ \\
    \midrule
    Area & $\sim10$ deg$^2$ around each pointing \\
    \midrule
    Pointing / Sky Region & Fields containing a star bright enough to compromise measurements on: \\
      & \tabitem Amplifier \\
      & \tabitem Detector \\
      & \tabitem Raft \\
      & \tabitem Significant fraction of focal plane \\
    \midrule
    Visit / Exposure Time & Standard visit \\
    \midrule
    Dither Pattern & Scan pointing across bright star so that the object appears at multiple locations on the focal plane as well as slightly outside the field of view.  \\
    \midrule
    Cadence & Not constrained, probably take observations of a given field together in a single epoch \\
    \midrule
    Time Baseline & Not constrained, probably take observations of a given field together in a single epoch \\
    \midrule
    Delivered Image Quality & Could begin with 2.0 arcsec delivered PSF FWHM across the full FoV \\
    \midrule
    Airmass distribution & Not constrained, $z < 1.4$ \\
    \midrule
    Environmental Conditions & \tabitem Photometric \\
    \midrule
    Representative Dataset Types & \tabitem DRP mode: Source, Object \\
      & Need to build coadd images to inspect residual effects of scattered light and ghosts \\
