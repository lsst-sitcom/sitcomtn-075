    \textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Notes} \\
    \midrule
    Primary Objectives & \tabitem Determine reference flat (illumination correction) independent of CBP \\
      & \tabitem Determine instrumental astrometric model \\
    \midrule
    Additional Goals & \tabitem Initial testing of building coaddition and difference imaging \\
    \midrule
    Prerequisites & \tabitem White light flats have been acquired \\
      & \tabitem Monochromatic flats have been acquired \\
    \midrule
    Total Visits & 120 \visits $\times$ 3 \epochs = 360 \visits \\
    \midrule
    Overlapping Visits & 30 visits in each of griz during each epoch (comparable to single year of LSST WFD integrated exposure) \\
    \midrule
    Band Coverage & griz \\
    \midrule
    Area & Central region of $\sim$10 deg$^2$ (focal plane dithers around a single central pointing) \\
    \midrule
    Pointing / Sky Region & Region of moderately high stellar density, but not so dense that blending is a concern. Low interstellar extinction \\
    \midrule
    Visit / Exposure Time & Standard visit \\
    \midrule
    Dither Pattern & Dithers from sensor scale up to focal plane scale with translation (rotation needed??) around a central pointing so that the same stars appear on many different sensors across the focal plane \\
    \midrule
    Cadence & Repeated visits within a single epoch. Alternate between filters within an epoch so that stars are observed in griz bands within a single epoch. \\
    \midrule
    Time Baseline & $\sim$120 minutes within epoch, epochs on 3 consecutive nights \\
    \midrule
    Delivered Image Quality & \tabitem 0.7 system contribution to PSF FWHM across the full FoV \\
      & \tabitem 1.0 delivered PSF FWHM across the full FoV \\
    \midrule
    Airmass distribution & Observe same field in in three epochs to sample a range of airmass of 1.0, 1.4, 2.0 \\
    \midrule
    Environmental Conditions & \tabitem Photometric \\
