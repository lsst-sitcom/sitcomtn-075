    \toprule
    \textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Notes} \\
    \midrule
    Primary Objectives & \tabitem Determine reference flat (illumination correction) independent of CBP \\
      & \tabitem Determine instrumental astrometric model \\
    \midrule
    Additional Goals & \tabitem Initial testing of building coaddition and difference imaging \\
    \midrule
    Prerequisites & \tabitem LED flats have been acquired \\
      & \tabitem Monochromatic flats have been acquired (iterations approaching System First Light) \\
    \midrule
    Total Visits & 120 \visits $\times$ 6 \epochs = 720 \visits (8 hrs total; 6 epochs of 80 min each) \\
    \midrule
    Overlapping Visits & 30 visits in each of ugri (dark time) or rizy (bright time) in each epoch; epochs span range of airmass; comparable to single year of LSST WFD integrated exposure \\
    \midrule
    Band Coverage & ugrizy (4 bands in a given epoch is sufficient) \\
    \midrule
    Area & Central region of $\sim$10 deg$^2$ (focal plane dithers around a single central pointing) \\
    \midrule
    Pointing / Sky Region & Region of moderately high stellar density, but not so dense that blending is a concern. Low interstellar extinction \\
    \midrule
    Visit / Exposure Time & Standard visit \\
    \midrule
    Dither Pattern & Dithers from sensor scale up to focal plane scale with translation (rotation needed??) around a central pointing so that the same stars appear on many different sensors across the focal plane \\
    \midrule
    Cadence & Repeated visits within a single epoch. Alternate between filters within an epoch so that stars are observed in griz bands within a single epoch. \\
    \midrule
    Time Baseline & $\sim$80 minutes within epoch; epochs can be on separate nights (close spacing preferred) \\
    \midrule
    Delivered Image Quality & Can begin when no strong gradients in PSF across FoV \\
      & \tabitem 0.7 arcsec system contribution to PSF FWHM across the full FoV \\
      & \tabitem 1.0 arcsec delivered PSF FWHM across the full FoV \\
    \midrule
    Airmass distribution & Observe same field in in three epochs to sample a range of airmass: 1.0, 1.4, 2.0 \\
    \midrule
    Environmental Conditions & \tabitem Photometric \\
    \midrule
    Representative Dataset Types & DRP mode: \\
      & \tabitem Source, Object, ForcedSource, DiaSource, DiaObject, DiaForcedSource \\
      & AP mode: (could be replay) \\
      & \tabitem DiaObject, DiaSource, DIAForcedSource \\
      \midrule
    Success Criteria & \tabitem Verification of astrometric and photometric internal solution \\
      & \tabitem Verification of acceptable image quality across full FoV across range of airmass as part of System First Light milestone \\
