\section{Introduction}

This work planning document supplements the Rubin Observatory Commissioning Plan \citedsp{LSE-79}, providing a more detailed narrative description for the sequence of on-sky and in-dome data acquisition, data processing, and verification campaigns during the period of LSSTCam on-sky commissioning, considering Active Optics System (AOS) commissioning, calibration systems, and Science Programs together.
The objective is to provide sufficient detail to understand linkages between activities in the overall commissioning schedule and to empower the team to progress on specific work packages for each of the activities described, e.g., write observing scripts / scheduler configurations, plan data processing campaigns, develop science verification and validation analyses.
We identify open questions for further study.
Detailed work planning will be captured in other tools (e.g., P6 and Jira).

\subsection{Science Validation Surveys}

Plan to interleave survey components so that both survey components have observations on many distinct nights

Option to emphasize deep component in case that there is processing time needed for template generation and/or infrastructure issues for AP that need to be worked

There is probably some careful thinking to do with the optimization of the scheduler on whether to prioritize template building initially, or to prioritize getting some repeated visits in areas with templates to get an early look at DIA. I think based on discussions with AP team that prioritization of template building is preferred at the start. If there is uncertainty on the duration of the SV survey period, there will also be thinking to do on balance of adding area versus adding more repeated observations of fields with existing templates.
