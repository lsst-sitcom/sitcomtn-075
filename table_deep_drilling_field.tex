    \toprule
    \textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Notes} \\
    \midrule
    Primary Objectives & \tabitem Verify that scattered light and other artifacts can be mitigated with nominal LSST DDF dither strategy and acceptable masking \\
    \midrule
    Additional Goals & \tabitem Test building coadds $>100$ visits \\
      & \tabitem Test DIA \\
    \midrule
    Prerequisites & \tabitem Acceptable image quality across full FoV at a particular airmass \\
      & \tabitem Initial analysis of Bright Star Scans to evaluate ghosts and scattered light in LSSTCam \\
    \midrule
    Total Visits & 5 \epochs $\times$ 40 \visits $\times$ 6 bands = 1200 \visits (6 epochs w/ 200 visits per epoch given 5 filters in LSSTCam at a time) \\
    \midrule
    Overlapping Visits & $ugrizy$ = (200, 200, 200, 200, 200, 200) \\
    \midrule
    Band Coverage & $ugrizy$ (aim for 6 band coverage) \\
    \midrule
    Area & $\sim$10 deg$^2$ (single DDF) \\
    \midrule
    Pointing / Sky Region & One of the LSST Deep Drilling Fields \\
    \midrule
    Visit / Exposure Time & Standard visit \\
    \midrule
    Dither Pattern & Nominal LSST DDF dithering strategy. Note that will probably need to observe with a variety of transational offsets and rotator angles to simulate the distribution that would be obtained in LSST survey. \\
    \midrule
    Cadence & Repeated consecutive visits within an epoch. Alternate between bands. \\
    \midrule
    Time Baseline & Epochs on separate nights \\
    \midrule
    Delivered Image Quality & \tabitem 0.7 system contribution to PSF FWHM across the full FoV \\
      & \tabitem 1.0 delivered PSF FWHM across the full FoV \\
    \midrule
    Airmass distribution & Sample nominal airmass range from LSST 10-year survey \\
    \midrule
    Environmental Conditions & Need dark time for $ugr$ \\
    \midrule
    Representative Dataset Types & DRP mode: \\
      & \tabitem Source, Object, ForcedSource, DiaSource, DiaObject, DiaForcedSource \\
      & AP mode: \\
      & \tabitem DiaObject, DiaSource, DIAForcedSource \\
      \midrule
    Success Criteria & Technical report to inform recommendation for initial DDF dither strategy at the start of LSST 10-year survey \\
